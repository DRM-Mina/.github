# DRM Mina ðŸŽ®
## Game Marketplace with DRM protection in Mina

DRM Mina is a game marketplace that connects game creators and players on Mina. It uses Mina's zk-proofs as an alternative to today's anti-piracy systems, preventing authorized or unauthorized use of 3rd party applications and users' data, as well as removing the dependency of game ownership on game markets, preventing monopolies and high deductions from game developers. 

## How It Works

#### Buying game from market and registering device to play

DRM Mina app-chain contains 3 main modules that:
`Balances` control user balance (in Mina) to buy games.
`GameToken` allow creators to publish their games, customize them and controls the sales of games.
`DRM` keep device information (their hash of course just for verify proofs) of users that have bought game, and their device's last session informations.

First, game producers register their games in the system using `GameToken` with a submission fee (currently 0 fee in testnet). In doing so, they set their own properties such as: 
```
gamePrice
discount
timeoutInterval
number_of_devices_allowed
``` 
and only they can change them afterwards. In this way, users can purchase the game added to the system. 

Users purchase their games or can pay for their frinds and gift to them on Mina by paying the sales amount `gamePrice - discount` set by the publisher with Mina (Figure - 1, Arrow - 1). Users who have purchased the game are stored as:
```
[key: (gameId, UserPublicKey)] -> value: Bool
```
After buying the game (even *without buying* it, or **from any source** ðŸ¤¯) users can download games to their computers. However, they will need to register their device in order to play. To submit their devices, they use zk-proofs with a built-in system to ensure privacy. This not only ensures privacy but also prevents them from spoofing information they don't have. (Figure - 1, Arrow - 2)
These are the unique identifiers that our system uses to distinguish devices from each other:
```
cpuId
systemSerial
systemUUID
baseboardSerial
macAddress
diskSerial (not supported yet, but soon)
```

After the device information is collected (**without taking it out of the user's computer**), the hash is created with the zk-program to save it by passing it through some calculations such as, does the information being saved meet the specified criterias? (Figure-2)

This proof allows the device to be registered in any slot of the user's choice from the number of slots specified by the game publisher. `min: 1, max: 4 slots` (Figure-1, Arrow-3 to *DRM Module*)

Now your device is set and ready to go ðŸš€
